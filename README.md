Stock Prediction &amp; Forecasting with LSTM Neural Networks
This is a project on Stock Prediction & Forecasting with LSTM Neural Networks using Python. Stock prediction is challenging due to the market being unpredictable at times. There are two ways to 'predict' the stock market. The first one being: fundamental analysis, which relies on a company's fundamental information suhc as expenses and annual growth rates, the second technique being technical anaylsis, which focuses on previous stock prices. Forecasting uses information from historical values and patterns associated in order to predict future stock fluctuation. In other words, we are analyzing trends, seasonality, and observing fluctuation. In my project, LSTM is used as follow: Input for sequential closing prices, capturing patterns, refine predictions based on features provided by LSTM (dense layers), output the predicted stock price.
